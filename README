# Testing procedures:
#
# Purpose:  
# to provide info in the diagnostic file for Sue
# to determine that the proper info is being "rolled up"
# and appearing in the "built" area.
#
# All of the "rules" are numbered and consistent with the rollupload wiki
# Sue&SE communicate via the rule# to determine which logic needs
# to be tested; isn't working propertly, etc.
#
# 1. set DEBUG = True
#       rollupallelelib.py
#       rollupmarkerlib.py
#       rollupload.py
#
# 2. testSQL:  add Genotypes (MGI:xxx) examples
#       which are provided by Sue and should be in the WTS2 ticket
